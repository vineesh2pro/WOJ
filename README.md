The development of proposed chat application (WhatsAppOnJava) begins with the collection of relevant data. All the modules of application are defined on Java following pure object-oriented concept thereby makes it highly independent of other technologies. The concept of serialization has been used to save the state of objects.

WhatsAppOnJava is an application which provide very neat and clean chatting interface through which one client/user can interact with other in very simple way with very less complexity and most importantly this application has file (jpeg, png, mp4, pdf, etc) sharing option, which makes this application very handy for sharing multi-media contents while chatting.
